# File System Simulator

This project is a simple file system simulator, created as part of my computer science/engineering studies. It is designed to mimic the functionality of a Linux file system, providing a hands-on way to understand how file systems work.

## Features

- A pre-defined example system to explore the project's capabilities.
- A set of commands similar to Linux for interacting with the file system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- `cmake`: The build system used for this project.

### Installation

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Create a new directory called `build` by running the command `mkdir build`.
3. Change into the `build` directory using `cd build`.
4. Generate the build files by running `cmake ..`.
5. Build the project by executing `cmake --build .`.

### Usage

To run the main program, use the command `./src/main`.

To run the tests, execute `./tests/google_testing`.

## Roadmap

Here are some changes that are planned for future versions of the project:

- Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.
- Implement the `cat` command to display the contents of a file.
- Overload operators in the sort function to support custom sorting criteria.
